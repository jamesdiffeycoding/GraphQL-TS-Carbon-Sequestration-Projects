## Inspiration
A few years ago I worked for Engaged Tracking (now Urgentem) as a Carbon Data Analyst. One of the things I did there was create a Python script to read documents and help me identify issues and omissions with their emissions reports. Now, to practice using GraphQL, I created a carbon disclosure database.

## What it does
The site currently displays data reached through GraphQL queries and renders it in a table.

## What is next for this project?
- CRUD functionality on the front-end so users can edit and update database information
- integration with an online database to host the data

## Built with
TypeScript, GraphQL, React
